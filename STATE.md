## Current governance posture

- Development-agent governance: active
- Runtime AI governance: policy defined, product enforcement pending by feature milestones
- Critical autonomous actions: disabled

## Active priorities

1. Feature development may begin — governance milestone READY.
2. Branch protection requires one-time GitHub Pro upgrade (manual action).
3. Keep governance validation green on all feature branches.
4. Maintain Electron and IPC security boundaries while expanding product features.
5. Maintain explicit human approval gate before clip rendering/publishing when AI recommendations are involved.

## Escalation triggers

- Repeated verifier failure on same scope (>= 3 attempts)
- Security-significant changes to main/preload/IPC/FFmpeg/filesystem paths
- Provider/model policy changes with privacy or retention impact
